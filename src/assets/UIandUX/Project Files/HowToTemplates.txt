How To Use These Files
------------------------
1. Open AFter Effects CS6 or Higher. (You might need to convert these files to CC)

2. When opening the files there will be multiple compositions inside. 

3. Most of these layers are locked if you look at the bottom.

4. If you want to edit or make changes unlock the chosen layer.

5. Most of these are color coded so background is always pink so don't uncheck that.

6. Anything that affects future compositions reflects that in the top left hand corner of the screen with the counter. (All of those compositions will be edited if you change it.

7. Have fun with working on the assets.

8. You need to export as JPEG Sequence or PNG Sequcne, don't do anything else or it creates a video.
